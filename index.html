    <div>All the info I know about Yosi and all the info I can find about Yoshi </div>
    <p>Yoshi is a green dino and he is the sort of pet of Mario. Mario also rides on Yoshi's back and while he is riding his back he can slam on Yoshi's neck and Yoshi will eventualy stick out his tongue.</p>
    <p>Yoshi's exist in multiple colors and the official colors are: Red, Orange, Yellow, Yoshi/ Green, Light Blue, Pink, Purple, Magnenta, White, Black, Brown and here are the unofficial colors: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Emerald etc.</p>
    <p>Yoshi's real name is : T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas. But according to an old Nintendo guide shared by author Blake Harris, the character originally had a far more convoluted name more befitting of a dinosaur. However, that long scientific-sounding name doesn't roll off the tongue quite like Yoshi does, so it's easy to see why Nintendo chose to omit it from their general marketing. </p>
    <p>Here is a short fact about Yoshi: Yoshi can gobble enemies with his long tongue, and lay eggs that doubly function as projectiles.</p>
