    <title>All the info I know about Yosi and all the info I can find about Yoshi</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>I don't know if all this information is official, but it is still information.</div>
    <p>Yoshi is a green dino and he is the sort of pet of Mario. Mario also rides on Yoshi's back and while he is riding his back he can slam on Yoshi's neck and Yoshi will eventualy stick out his tongue.</p>
    <p>Yoshi's exist in multiple colors and the official colors are: Red, Orange, Yellow, Yoshi/ Green, Light Blue, Pink, Purple, Magnenta, White, Black, Brown and here are the unofficial colors: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Emerald etc.</p>
    <p>Yoshi's real name is : T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas. But according to an old Nintendo guide shared by author Blake Harris, the character originally had a far more convoluted name more befitting of a dinosaur. However, that long scientific-sounding name doesn't roll off the tongue quite like Yoshi does, so it's easy to see why Nintendo chose to omit it from their general marketing. </p>
    <p>Here is a short fact about Yoshi: Yoshi can gobble enemies with his long tongue, and lay eggs that doubly function as projectiles.</p>
    <p>Since Yoshi's debut was official he could also get in games and here are the games Yoshi is in: Mario World, Yoshi's Crafted World, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World, Yoshi's Woolly World, Yoshi's New Island, Yoshi's Island DS, Yoshi Touch & Go, Mario Kart DS, Yoshi's Universal Gravitation, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Yoshi's Story, Tetris Attack, Super Mario World 2: Yosi's Island, Yoshi's Safari, Yoshi's Cookie, Super Mario Kart and Mario and Yoshi. This are currently in 2025 all the games Yoshi is in</p>
    <p>For those who don't know: Mario World is the newest mario race game and it is only playable on the new Nintendo Switch 2 and another short fact Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World and Yoshi's Woolly World are 2 different games, Yoshi's Woolly world is only on the Wii U and Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World is only on 3DS</p>
    <p>The genders of Yoshi's: The green Yoshi we know as the original Yoshi is a boy but, Yoshi's can be boys and girls</p>
